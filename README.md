Sent Flutter Application

Utilized Flutter to create a cross-platform application. This is an uncomplete project.

Hundreds of students travel home every weekend, yet students find it hard to get packages from their home without high shipping costs and long delivery times. 

Sent is creating a platform that connects students going home with students wanting packages from home. Students receiving packages save by paying less than traditional shipping options, and students carrying packages earn by monetizing the empty space in their travel bags. Itâ€™s an app for students, by students. 

Sent started as a Facebook group that connected students across campus. While the Facebook group still functions and is currently delivering orders, our vision is to continue growing. Team Sent is in the process of creating a mobile application which can ease platform access and reach a larger audience. Longhorn Startup allows for us to be in a collaborative environment that gives us the resources to refine and market our app, post development.
